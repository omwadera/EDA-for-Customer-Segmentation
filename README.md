# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for Task 3 of my Edu Nexa Internship, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The project explores a dataset from a shopping mall's customer records, utilizing various statistical measures and visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships within the data.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `Clustering.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the entire code for the exploratory analysis, including univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, and clustering.
- `Clustering.csv`: The final dataset with added cluster labels.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and its components.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## Key Steps

1. **Univariate Analysis**: Descriptive statistics, distplots, kernel density plots, and box plots for individual features.
2. **Bivariate Analysis**: Scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrix for understanding relationships between variables.
3. **Clustering - Univariate, Bivariate, Multivariate**: KMeans clustering for different features and combinations of features.
4. **Multivariate Analysis**: Standardizing data using StandardScaler and applying KMeans clustering to explore multivariate patterns.

## How to Use

- The main analysis is captured in the `Clustering.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. Simply open it using a Jupyter environment or any compatible notebook viewer.
- The final dataset with cluster labels is saved as `Clustering.csv` and can be utilized for further analysis or exploration.
